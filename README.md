# Models-sample

For people not accustomed to github, the easiest way to download the meta model is to r-click on the green "code" drop-down (above), then "download zip".  Once unzipped on your local machine, open the northwind2/master.xsd using Splicer Enterprise Designer.  You can find downloads for it here: https://splicer.io/trial.html.
