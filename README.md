# Models-sample

For people not accustomed to github, the easiest way to download the meta model is to r-click on the green "code" drop-down (above), then "download zip".  Once unzipped on your local machine, open the northwind2/master.xsd using Splicer Enterprise Designer (SED): use File->Open within the SED app.

You can find downloads for SED here: https://splicer.io/trial.html.
