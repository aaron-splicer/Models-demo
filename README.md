# Models-sample

This project includes sample Splicer data models.

- **platform**: This is our baseline model.  Start with this one to create a data model from scratch.  Assume the Person object is the login user for your system.  
- **traffic-ticket**: A simple example of how we might model a traffic ticket website.
- **northwind2**: Northwind is a sample small-business ERP database schema from Microsoft - though we use a version ported for MySQL. From this schema, we reverse-engineered to create our Splicer data model.
- **omop**: This is a data model for the OMOP CDM, which is a highly generalized schema for medical practice.  "The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) is an open community data standard, designed to standardize the structure and content of observational data."  

For people not accustomed to github, the easiest way to download the meta model is to r-click on the green "code" drop-down (above), then "download zip".  Once unzipped on your local machine, use File->Import to import this project within the SED app.

You can find downloads for SED here: https://splicer.io/trial.html.
